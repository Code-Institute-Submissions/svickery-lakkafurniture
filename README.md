Unfortunately my ReadME is not in depth. There have been major issues with me deploying to heroku and due to time constraints as mentioned above, I could not complete the site as necessary. I know that I will have failed this project and I will have to retake. I used a lot of templates from a project on code institute and I didn't even have the time necessary to style it how I wanted. I couldn't write in the content I wanted. But the back bone of the project is there. I just ran out of time to make it as stylistically as good as I wanted.  

A website designed for the sale of bespoke furniture goods. It is a site that was birthed from making many bespoke items over the years and deciding to mass produce some of their best products. The idea is so that all people can have unique furniture in their home. While they sell stock items, the company still can be contacted for bespoke work and quotes. 

The user goals of the website are as follows:

* Buy unique, bespoke furniture for their home
* To be able to search for particular furniture
* To join the website
* Once the user has joined, they can view their order history and save default delivery information
* To be able to add, delete and edit their purchases at checkout
* Have the option to log in and out of website
* See details of all items on the site.

## UX

#### Ideal user for the website:

* Furniture lovers
* People needing to furnish a new home
* People within the industry 
* Willing to become a member 
* Enjoys an alternative to mainstream furniture companies

#### Visitors for the website will be looking for:

* Furniture to buy
* Be able to check the ratings of products available
* Check the pictures and descriptions of products
* Search for whichever furniture they like in the database
* A pleasant visual experience in line with the products, clean and efficient

#### This website is best to help users because:

* Most furniture sites are flat pack and not unique
* It allows the user to be involved with the website and become a member
* This website is:
    - Easy to navigate
    - Efficient with information
    - Professionally designed and visually appealing

The site changed a lot from its original conception. Due to time constraints due to health issues and working a full time job also I had to rapidly change while thinking on my feet. The basic needs are there, but I would have preferred to add a review system to the site.  

## Features

The website has a scrolling effect on the index page and reviews page using a parallax effect. This is so the website not only looks good but also be navigated easily. There are seperate pages for different needs such as sign up form, log in form and add review form once a member. The navigation bar has been fixed at the top so that all pages are available during use of the site. In total there are nine pages available to use. However if you are not a member there are only four pages to view. On the reviews page there is a search bar to search for whichever movie they would like to see a review of. There is a footer with social media links at the bottom of each page. This footer also contatins copyright information.  

#### Home

The Home page features one large photography covering the top of the page. This includes hero text on the image. The hero text has a link to join the website as a member. Below the image there is an about section explaining to the user what the website is for and how they can get involved themselves. The name of the site also appears as a header and there is no logo used for the site. 

#### Reviews

The reviews page has a similar layout to the home page with a large image at the top and hero text allowing the user to join as a member easily. Below this image there are then cards which have large eye catching images and beneath those images, there is all the information you would need about a movie. Below that further is the review of the movie. This review section has a scrolling effect so that the user doesn't have to navigate elsewhere to read it in its full form. At the bottom of the review is the contributors name.   

#### Sign Up

A page linked on both the home and review pages. There is a basic form for your details to become a contributor to the site. This form also has a link to the terms and conditions of the website.   

#### Log In

This page has a simple log in form for users who are already members. 

#### Profile 

Once a user has logged in, they will be redirected immediately to their own profile page. This has a flash message to welcome the user, a title for the profile user and an add review button underneath. This is designed to encourage the user to contribute immediately. Beneath that the user will be able to see all their past reviews they have written. Each review has an option to edit and delete in bold red. The edit function opens a new page.

#### Add Review

Located in the navigation bar as well as being able to from the previously mentioned add review button on the profile page. Users can add a review whenever the choose and will be given a simple form to follow. This includes a url link for the user to add for the review. Once the information is complete and the review is written, there is a submit button to add this to the site. This review will be visible to all people navigating to the site. Dropdown menu's have been added to the genre and rating fields, to make it easier for the user.

#### Edit Review

This is not available in the navigation but links directly from the edit button. This page will render all the previous information supplied in the review. Dropdown menu's have been added to the genre and rating fields, to make it easier for the user. 

#### Log Out

This is located in the navbar and is only a single click function. 

#### Terms and Conditions

Not located in the navbar and only accessible from the sign up form. 

#### Footer

In the footer is copyright information and links to the social media sites.

#### Possible Future Features

* Use an API to bring local current showing times in cinemas near them. 
* A comments section for each review. Only members are allowed to use this.
* Could be expanded to include TV shows also.
