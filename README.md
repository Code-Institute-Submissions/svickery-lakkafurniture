Unfortunately my ReadME is not in depth. There have been major issues with me deploying to heroku and due to time constraints as mentioned above, I could not complete the site as necessary. I know that I will have failed this project and I will have to retake. I used a lot of templates from a project on code institute and I didn't even have the time necessary to style it how I wanted. I couldn't write in the content I wanted. But the back bone of the project is there. I just ran out of time to make it as stylistically as good as I wanted.  

A website designed for the sale of bespoke furniture goods. It is a site that was birthed from making many bespoke items over the years and deciding to mass produce some of their best products. The idea is so that all people can have unique furniture in their home. While they sell stock items, the company still can be contacted for bespoke work and quotes. 

The user goals of the website are as follows:

* Buy unique, bespoke furniture for their home
* To be able to search for particular furniture
* To join the website
* Once the user has joined, they can view their order history and save default delivery information
* To be able to add, delete and edit their purchases at checkout
* Have the option to log in and out of website
* See details of all items on the site.

## UX

#### Ideal user for the website:

* Furniture lovers
* People needing to furnish a new home
* People within the industry

* Furniture to buy
* Be able to check the ratings of products available
* Check the pictures and descriptions of products

#### This website is best to help users because:

## Wireframes

[View Wireframes Here](https://www.figma.com/file/dNiiFzoZEROA2xMzoSifbT/Lakka-Furniture?node-id=0%3A1)

The site changed a lot from its original conception. The original wireframes are there in style but the direction of the site changed a lot during the build. Due to time constraints due to health issues and working a full time job also I had to rapidly change while thinking on my feet. The basic needs are there, but I would have preferred to add a review system to the site.  

## Features

The website has a scrolling effect throughout. This is so the website not only looks good but also be navigated easily. There are seperate pages for different needs such as sign up form, log in form and add blog post form once a member. You can also add a review, if you are a member or not. The navigation bar has been fixed at the top so that all pages are available during use of the site.  

#### Home

The Home page features one large photograph covering the top of the page. There is no hero text. The menu and search bar are easily navigated and the my profile page is visible immediately, as is the shopping trolley image.

#### About Us

The about us section is featured on the hope page, one section down from the hero image mentioned above. The about us is short and sweet, containing some writing about how the company started and what is on offer on the site. This flows down to the footer as it mentions the contact details needed in the about us section. 

#### Footer

On every page. The footer contains copyright, contact and some info about Lakka. There are also links to social media pages. 

#### Register

Embedded in the My Profile menu in the main navigation. The register page is what it says on the tin. You can register with an email, username and password. Very simple.   

#### Log In

This page has a simple log in form for users who are already members. 

#### Profile 

Profile page contains profile information wanted by a customer. Not only is it delivery details etc but an entire order history from the site. 

#### Products

The products are featured in each individual product section in the same way. They are centered on the page to show a big image of the item and show the price and short description. Admin users can see an edit and delete function. All products are scrollable on the page and the amount of products depends on which section the user has clicked on.

#### Product Details

Once clicking on a product from the product page, you are taken to a singular item page which shows a bigger picture of the item, a description, a rating and price. There is an add to bag button for each item. Which is self explanatory. There is a back to shopping button too, if the user decides not to buy the product.

#### Add Review

Located on the product details page. Any user of the site can add a review of any item on the site.

#### Blog

A new item for super users. This is so fellow woodmakers can offer tips, advertise products and show tutorials. It is for the woodworking community to help one another. On the initial page there will be a snippet of text from the blog post, a title and who wrote the article. When you click on the article, the full content will appear. This is then editable or deletable for the authorised user.

#### Checkout

Once products have been selected the user will click the shopping trolley icon, which will be obvious due to the success messages that apppear when adding a product to the basket. You will then be taken to a Your Items page. This will confirm the items you would like to purchase. Click secure checkout. You can then either checkout as a guest or make yourself a member of the site. Either way you will be given purchase confirmation when complete.

#### Log Out

This is located in the navbar and is only a single click function. 

#### Possible Future Features

* A contact page to directly message the website owners. 
* A comments section for each blog post.
* Could be expanded to include more e-commerce items.
