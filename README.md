A website designed for the sale of bespoke furniture goods. It is a site that was birthed from making many bespoke items over the years and deciding to mass produce some of their best products. The idea is so that all people can have unique furniture in their home. While they sell stock items, the company still can be contacted for bespoke work and quotes. 

The user goals of the website are as follows:

* Buy unique, bespoke furniture for their home
* To be able to search for particular furniture
* To join the website
* Once the user has joined, they can view their order history and save default delivery information
* To be able to add, delete and edit their purchases at checkout
* Have the option to log in and out of website
* See details of all items on the site.

## UX

#### Ideal user for the website:

* Furniture lovers
* People needing to furnish a new home
* People within the industry

* Furniture to buy
* Be able to check the ratings of products available
* Check the pictures and descriptions of products
* Search for whichever furniture they like in the database

#### This website is best to help users because:

* Most furniture sites are flat pack and not unique

## Wireframes

[View Wireframes Here](https://www.figma.com/file/dNiiFzoZEROA2xMzoSifbT/Lakka-Furniture?node-id=0%3A1)

The site changed a lot from its original conception. The original wireframes are there in style but the direction of the site changed a lot during the build. Due to time constraints due to health issues and working a full time job also I had to rapidly change while thinking on my feet. The basic needs are there, but I would have preferred to add a review system to the site.  

## Features

The website has a scrolling effect throughout. This is so the website not only looks good but also be navigated easily. There are seperate pages for different needs such as sign up form, log in form and add blog post form once a member. You can also add a review, if you are a member or not. The navigation bar has been fixed at the top so that all pages are available during use of the site.  

#### Home

The Home page features one large photograph covering the top of the page. There is no hero text. The menu and search bar are easily navigated and the my profile page is visible immediately, as is the shopping trolley image.

#### About Us

The about us section is featured on the hope page, one section down from the hero image mentioned above. The about us is short and sweet, containing some writing about how the company started and what is on offer on the site. This flows down to the footer as it mentions the contact details needed in the about us section. 

#### Footer

On every page. The footer contains copyright, contact and some info about Lakka. There are also links to social media pages. 

#### Register

Embedded in the My Profile menu in the main navigation. The register page is what it says on the tin. You can register with an email, username and password. Very simple. Once registered, the user will have to confirm their email before proceeding.   

#### Log In

This page has a simple log in form for users who are already members. 

#### Profile 

Profile page contains profile information wanted by a customer. Not only is it delivery details etc but an entire order history from the site. 

#### Products

The products are featured in each individual product section in the same way. They are centered on the page to show a big image of the item and show the price and short description. Admin users can see an edit and delete function. All products are scrollable on the page and the amount of products depends on which section the user has clicked on.

#### Product Details

Once clicking on a product from the product page, you are taken to a singular item page which shows a bigger picture of the item, a description, a rating and price. There is an add to bag button for each item. Which is self explanatory. There is a back to shopping button too, if the user decides not to buy the product.

#### Add Review

Located on the product details page. Any user of the site can add a review of any item on the site.

#### Blog

A new item for super users. This is so fellow woodmakers can offer tips, advertise products and show tutorials. It is for the woodworking community to help one another. On the initial page there will be a snippet of text from the blog post, a title and who wrote the article. When you click on the article, the full content will appear. This is then editable or deletable for the authorised user.

#### Checkout

Once products have been selected the user will click the shopping trolley icon, which will be obvious due to the success messages that apppear when adding a product to the basket. You will then be taken to a Your Items page. This will confirm the items you would like to purchase. Click secure checkout. You can then either checkout as a guest or make yourself a member of the site. Either way you will be given purchase confirmation when complete.

#### Log Out

This is located in the navbar and is only a single click function. 

#### Possible Future Features

* A contact page to directly message the website owners. 
* A comments section for each blog post.
* Could be expanded to include more e-commerce items.
* Better logic to differentiate between members and super users. 


## Technologies Used

* The project uses HTML, CSS and JavaScript languages. 
* [Github](https://github.com/) - I used this for all coding (IDE) while building the website.
* [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.5/getting-started/introduction/) - Used for grid layouts and cards on my page. Also allowed me to use Font Awesome icons for my social media links. 
* [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) - Used for icons in conjuction with bootstrap. 
* [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) - Used for entire website fonts.
* [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) - Used for styling forms etc from bootstrap. 
* [Web Formatter](https://webformatter.com/) - Used to make my code cleaner and easier to read.
* [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) - Used to help with various coding questions.
* [Autoprefixer](https://autoprefixer.github.io/) - Used to ensure CSS is correct
* [JQuery](https://jquery.com/) - Used for JQuery elements applied in JavaScript and some help with writing code.
* [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) - Used to beautify the json files.
* [W3 Validator](https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input) - Used to ensure HTML is correct.
* [JS Lint](https://jslint.com/) - Used to ensure JavaScript is correct.
* [Python](https://www.python.org/) - Language used to present data.
* [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) - Database used for site data schema.
* [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) - Python Framework used for many shortcuts in coding.
* [Jinja](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/3.0.x/) - Templating language used with Python and Flask.
* [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.0.x/) - Web framework used with Python.
* [Heroku](https://id.heroku.com/login) - Cloud based app for deploying websites.

## Database Schema

Below shows the database schema used and how they flow together with the arrows.

## Testing

* Testing for this site consisted of two things. Using validators to check the code and me personally testing every page to ensure they work. 

[Markup Validator](https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input) 

![alt text](https://github.com/svickery/lakkafurniture/blob/839efaa85af7f06d6d3d5fcbcb689024dbad7ebf/readme/htmlexample.jpeg "HTML Validator")

The errors that have shown up are ones that can't be avoided. The errors are either in the head or the scripts section. The validator doesn't recognise jquery correctly and the head data is from VS Code's own template. 

[CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/ "CSS Validator") 

![alt text](https://github.com/svickery/lakkafurniture/blob/839efaa85af7f06d6d3d5fcbcb689024dbad7ebf/readme/cssexample.jpeg "CSS Validator")

There were zero errors on the CSS.

[JavaScript Validator](https://jslint.com/)

![alt text](https://github.com/svickery/lakkafurniture/blob/839efaa85af7f06d6d3d5fcbcb689024dbad7ebf/readme/jsexample.jpeg)

The JS validator shows up some issues with certain characters being used, such as the use of '$' and to use double quotes. However this would make the code unusable. Validator doesn't seem to recognise jquery.

[Python Validator](http://pep8online.com/)

![alt text](https://github.com/svickery/lakkafurniture/blob/839efaa85af7f06d6d3d5fcbcb689024dbad7ebf/readme/pep8example.jpeg "Python Validator")

Most of the python files passed the validator, but some didn't due to unavoidable logic. The most common error was that the code line was too long. However if you moved some of the logic to another line it would break the site.
